The SMP or Sparse Matrix Package is used by SPICE3 to manipulate the sparse matrix generated by the application
of the madoified nodel analysis a;gorithm to the circuit,
This package is NOT a general sparse matrix package but is intended specifically to handle the problems of solving MNA
problems.
All of the function descriptions assume that the header file "SMPdefs.h" has already been included in the current
source file.
The header file not only declares all of the data types involved, but also provides complete declarations of all
of the funcitons involved and wil include any subsidiary header files which are needed.
